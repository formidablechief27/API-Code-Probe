### Project Description: Simple Code and API Tester Website

**Project Overview:**
This project involves creating a web application that allows users to input code snippets and API endpoints to test their functionality. The frontend will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend will be developed using Java Spring Boot. The project will include functionalities to execute code snippets in various programming languages and to test API endpoints by sending HTTP requests and displaying the responses. Automated testing will ensure the reliability of the application.

#### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Create the layout for the input forms, display areas, and buttons for executing code and testing APIs.
- **CSS**: Style the application to ensure it is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Handle user interactions, make asynchronous requests to the backend, and update the UI based on the results.

#### Backend:
- **Java Spring Boot**: Serve as the backend to process the code execution requests and API testing. It will execute the code snippets using appropriate interpreters or compilers and send HTTP requests to the provided API endpoints, returning the results to the frontend.

This setup provides a complete solution for a code and API tester website, including frontend, backend, and testing components.
